<h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-75585620 gb-headline-text">COVID-19 Strategy</h2>



<p>In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic a wide range of companies<br>decided – or will soon decide – to transition to remote working. The spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented measures, first by governments and now businesses, as they try to limit the spread of the virus. In addition to restricting travel and cancelling large events, a growing number of companies are now rethinking their ways of working. While production workers as well as system-relevant workforce such as medical staff are still working on-site, a majority of the remaining workforce in has been encouraged or even mandated to work remotely.</p>



<p>Working remotely under these circumstances means adapting to a new environment, battling a new set of distractions as well as experiencing an unprecedented fusion of work and private life. In order to continue working efficiently and creating value under these new circumstances, organizations need to understand, accept and support their employees’ specific situations and needs.</p>



<p>The following personas should help employers to understand their workforce and intend to visualize some of their specific situations and needs. However, there are some aspects that all of these<br>personas have in common: they all face a multitude of information about COVID-19, need to re-arrange their work and personal life and therefore might experience a stressful phase.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-4965b32b gb-headline-text">Understanding the stressful situation</h3>



<p><strong>Frequent challenges</strong></p>



<ul><li> Working remotely / from home means battling a new set of “distractions”</li><li> Lack of commitment, as meetings, workshops or labs are “only” virtual</li><li> Technical issues may prevent some employees from getting their work done, logging in to a specific technology or using all features of virtual meetings, workshops or labs tools</li><li> Screen fatigue causes the attention span to shorten, as starring at a laptop screen is more exhausting than face-to-face interaction</li><li>Team members cannot engage directly with their colleagues and leaders and may feel disconnected, less creative or less productive</li><li>Working remotely / from home often results in a fusion of work and private life and some employees may have difficulties to disengage at the end of the work day</li></ul>



<p><strong>Good Practices</strong></p>



<ul><li> Encourage everyone to set up an organized and quiet workplace and embrace “distractions” that cannot be avoided under the current circumstances</li><li>Establish buy-in from everyone and focus on the benefits of virtual meetings, workshops or labs (e.g. real-time visualization and note-taking)</li><li> Ensure everyone is familiar with the technology and tools, communicate ground rules (e.g. mandatory tech-check, everyone logs in via laptop) and provide fast support to solve unexpected technical issues (increasing server capacity and support via help desk might be necessary under the current circumstances)</li><li>Schedule compact sessions, use breakout sessions, frequently check-in with colleagues if they are still able to focus, schedule breaks accordingly</li><li>Encourage video calls and do not forget about socializing with colleagues and leaders to avoid a social disconnect</li><li>Support employees to maintain an appropriate work-life balance</li></ul>



<p>For many companies, large and small, remote work transitioned from an occasional option for a handful of individual employees to the new normal. Employees were no longer simply working from home. In some cases, employees were “remote working”—doing their jobs and fulfilling their responsibilities from a location that was not easily commutable to an official company office or worksite. </p>



<p>With a global health crisis in everyone’s mind, it was no longer fully feasible for many organizations who emphasized in-office culture to continue requiring all employees to continue their jobs on-site. Such situations were a catalyst for employers to become more innovative and, in fact, to reinvent the workplace. Creative solutions that emerged then permitted employees who had the ability to work from home to do so, with reconsideration of the spaces and operations that would have to continue on-site.<br></p>



<p>Remote work is the new reality and, perhaps, here to stay for the foreseeable future—although in varying degrees. Worldwide ERC® research, analyzed this trend. For example, while more employers stated before the pandemic that all or up to 25% of employees worked remotely, a smaller percentage of employers anticipated the same percentage of their workforce being remote in the future. The reverse held true for employers with 75% and 50% of their employees on a remote status. In effect, the most pronounced shift toward more employees working remotely in the future fell in the categories of 50% and 75% of employees.</p>

<h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-75585620 gb-headline-text"><a href="/cybersecurity/" data-type="URL" data-id="/cybersecurity/"><em>An old scam that keeps reinventing itself &#8230;</em>&nbsp;</a></h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard the classic&nbsp;business&nbsp;email&nbsp;compromise&nbsp;(BEC) scam&nbsp;about Nigerian princes&nbsp;who want&nbsp;to deposit money in&nbsp;people’s&nbsp;bank accounts—but first need&nbsp;their prey&nbsp;to send them money to make it all work to plan.&nbsp;It’s an oldie&nbsp;but goodie. Unfortunately,&nbsp;it’s also&nbsp;one that keeps reinventing itself along with another batch of unwitting victims.&nbsp;In fact, it happens so often, BEC scams currently outdo ransomware as the most damaging cyberattack in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, according to the FBI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a>&nbsp;(IC3), in 2020, losses from BEC exceeded $1.8 billion—that’s a fourfold increase since 2016! The number of BEC incidents also rose by 61% between 2016 and 2020. Using tactics that play off real-time world events,&nbsp;such as COVID-19 or the trust of established interpersonal relationships, criminal elements have managed to stay ahead of&nbsp;the good guys with increased&nbsp;sophistication&nbsp;and swiftness.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Healthcare provides bilked by criminals posing&nbsp;as trusted vendors with access to much-needed personal protection equipment&nbsp;</li><li>A large social media firm handed over personal payroll information about employees to an individual they thought was their CEO&nbsp;</li><li>A non-profit organization was fooled into transferring a large loan to a business partner right into the hands of the threat actor&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>To protect yourself and your business from these types of attacks, employee education is essential. For example, if someone in your accounts payable department receives an email from a business partner&nbsp;requesting you alter established wire transfer information,&nbsp;be sure&nbsp;your staff&nbsp;are trained to recognize the request as a red flag and confirm directly with their point of contact details of the&nbsp;change. It seems second nature, but when people are busy and working against deadlines, it’s easy to miss a well-disguised ruse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From a defense in-depth perspective, it’s also essential to ensure you have a layer of threat detection in place to help identify malicious behavior, alert of the threat, and inform the correct response and remediation measures. This would include:</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring for anomalous behavior, both on-premises and in the cloud</strong></p>



<p>BEC threats rely on looking like normal user activity. With an increase in remote work, companies are relying more on cloud services like Microsoft® Office 365® which puts data into a complex environment that&#8217;s often under-protected. Once threat actors can get access to Office 365, getting to the juicy data is just a few clicks away. Traditional perimeter security tools, such as firewalls, aren’t able to monitor suspicious activity in cloud-hosted applications like Office 365, SharePoint, or OneDrive. The same applies to monitoring of your endpoints for suspicious activity. If a threat actor slips past perimeter defense and acquires user credentials, it will be difficult to identify threats that appear as typical activity.</p>



<p><strong>Having enough IT Security staff</strong></p>



<p>When something nefarious goes down, you need to know immediately. Too many businesses lack the ability to dedicate staff to 24/7 monitoring of their environment. If an alert goes off at 1 a.m., the time lost until someone sees it and makes sense of it could be the difference between defense of the business or catastrophic damage. Managed threat detection and response can be a force multiplier if you are unable to monitor your environment 24/7.</p>



<p>While there are many aspects to improving your defense in-depth, the following from the FBI act as good and effective tips to share with employees to help elevate everyone’s awareness of how to avoid business email compromise attacks.</p>



<ul><li>Be skeptical—Last-minute changes in wiring instructions or recipient account information must be verified.</li><li>Don&#8217;t click it—Verify any changes and information via the contact on file—do not contact the vendor through the number provided in the email.</li><li>Double check that URL—Ensure the URL in the email is associated with the business it claims to be from.</li><li>Spelling counts—Be alert to misspelled hyperlinks in the actual domain name.</li><li>It&#8217;s a match—Verify the email address used to send emails, especially when using a mobile or handheld device, by ensuring the sender’s email address appears to match who it&#8217;s coming from.</li><li>Pay attention—Often there are clues with business email compromise, e.g.:<ul><li>An&nbsp;employee who does not normally interact with the CEO receives an urgent request from them</li><li>Data&nbsp;shows an employee in one location at&nbsp;1 p.m.&nbsp;but halfway around the globe 10 minutes later</li><li>Active&nbsp;activity from an employee who is supposed to be on leave&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>If you see something, say something—If something looks awry, report it to your managed service provider or IT Security supervisor. And if you have been a victim of BEC, file a detailed complaint with IC3.</li></ul>



<p><br>To learn more about business email compromise threats and defense against them, can provide you with guidance, education, and technology to strengthen your security posture. </p>
