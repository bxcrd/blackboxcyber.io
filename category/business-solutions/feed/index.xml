<p>In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic a wide range of companies<br>decided – or will soon decide – to transition to remote working. The spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented measures, first by governments and now businesses, as they try to limit the spread of the virus. In addition to restricting travel and cancelling large events, a growing number of companies are now rethinking their ways of working. While production workers as well as system-relevant workforce such as medical staff are still working on-site, a majority of the remaining workforce in has been encouraged or even mandated to work remotely.</p>



<p>Working remotely under these circumstances means adapting to a new environment, battling a new set of distractions as well as experiencing an unprecedented fusion of work and private life. In order to continue working efficiently and creating value under these new circumstances, organizations need to understand, accept and support their employees’ specific situations and needs.</p>



<p>The following personas should help employers to understand their workforce and intend to visualize some of their specific situations and needs. However, there are some aspects that all of these<br>personas have in common: they all face a multitude of information about COVID-19, need to re-arrange their work and personal life and therefore might experience a stressful phase.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-4965b32b gb-headline-text">Understanding the stressful situation</h3>



<p><strong>Frequent challenges</strong></p>



<ul><li> Working remotely / from home means battling a new set of “distractions”</li><li> Lack of commitment, as meetings, workshops or labs are “only” virtual</li><li> Technical issues may prevent some employees from getting their work done, logging in to a specific technology or using all features of virtual meetings, workshops or labs tools</li><li> Screen fatigue causes the attention span to shorten, as starring at a laptop screen is more exhausting than face-to-face interaction</li><li>Team members cannot engage directly with their colleagues and leaders and may feel disconnected, less creative or less productive</li><li>Working remotely / from home often results in a fusion of work and private life and some employees may have difficulties to disengage at the end of the work day</li></ul>



<p><strong>Good Practices</strong></p>



<ul><li> Encourage everyone to set up an organized and quiet workplace and embrace “distractions” that cannot be avoided under the current circumstances</li><li>Establish buy-in from everyone and focus on the benefits of virtual meetings, workshops or labs (e.g. real-time visualization and note-taking)</li><li> Ensure everyone is familiar with the technology and tools, communicate ground rules (e.g. mandatory tech-check, everyone logs in via laptop) and provide fast support to solve unexpected technical issues (increasing server capacity and support via help desk might be necessary under the current circumstances)</li><li>Schedule compact sessions, use breakout sessions, frequently check-in with colleagues if they are still able to focus, schedule breaks accordingly</li><li>Encourage video calls and do not forget about socializing with colleagues and leaders to avoid a social disconnect</li><li>Support employees to maintain an appropriate work-life balance</li></ul>



<p>For many companies, large and small, remote work transitioned from an occasional option for a handful of individual employees to the new normal. Employees were no longer simply working from home. In some cases, employees were “remote working”—doing their jobs and fulfilling their responsibilities from a location that was not easily commutable to an official company office or worksite. </p>



<p>With a global health crisis in everyone’s mind, it was no longer fully feasible for many organizations who emphasized in-office culture to continue requiring all employees to continue their jobs on-site. Such situations were a catalyst for employers to become more innovative and, in fact, to reinvent the workplace. Creative solutions that emerged then permitted employees who had the ability to work from home to do so, with reconsideration of the spaces and operations that would have to continue on-site.<br></p>



<p>Remote work is the new reality and, perhaps, here to stay for the foreseeable future—although in varying degrees. Worldwide ERC® research, analyzed this trend. For example, while more employers stated before the pandemic that all or up to 25% of employees worked remotely, a smaller percentage of employers anticipated the same percentage of their workforce being remote in the future. The reverse held true for employers with 75% and 50% of their employees on a remote status. In effect, the most pronounced shift toward more employees working remotely in the future fell in the categories of 50% and 75% of employees.</p>
